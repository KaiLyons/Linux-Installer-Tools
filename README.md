# Linux Installer Tools
What is this? What does it do?

These are simple and easy to use shell scripts. Usually made for lazy people. This will include sections for Arch, Debian, Ubuntu PPA's, and Fedora and soon Gentoo and OpenSUSE (not available because I am lazy). These will not be overly complex and just simple scripts that will need super user privilages.
